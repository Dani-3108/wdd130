            <p>Hi, I am Daniel Osorio. I am 23 years old and from Mexico. I currently live in Calimaya, State of Mexico, about two
            hours from Mexico City. I am studying Software Development through the BYU-Idaho online program. I work as a BDR at
            UnitX, selling AI vision systems for the manufacturing industry. I am happily married to the most amazing woman,
            Kenny. Our first anniversary will be on July 27, 2025. I love steak and steakhouses. I enjoy listening to music,
            especially rock and electronic. I am recovering from back pain, but I enjoy staying active and doing sports. I love
            spending time with my wife and family. I am always looking for new challenges and continuous improvement.</p>
